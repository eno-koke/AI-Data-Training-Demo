# 🧠 AI Data Training Demo  

This project demonstrates how data is labeled, structured, and prepared for **AI model training**.  
It’s a showcase of my experience as an **AI Data Trainer**, focusing on data consistency, quality, and annotation best practices.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate how datasets are cleaned and structured before being used in **machine learning models**.  
I’ve included examples of:
- Text classification tasks  
- Image labeling mockups  
- Quality control workflow  
- Annotation consistency examples  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques Used
- **Annotation Platforms:** Remotask, Labelbox  
- **Data Formats:** JSON, CSV  
- **Programming:** Python (for dataset validation)  
- **Documentation:** Markdown, GitHub  

---

## 🧩 Example Dataset
*(You can later upload a small CSV file here showing sample labeled data — e.g., sentences marked as “positive,” “negative,” or “neutral.”)*  

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Add sample scripts for data validation  
- Show workflow for AI feedback loop  
- Upload anonymized real-world examples
